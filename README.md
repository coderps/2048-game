# 2048-game
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS over a weekend, and released on 9 March 2014 as free and open-source software subject to the MIT license. There is also a version for the Linux terminal.

## Installation

## Playing the Game

Use arrow keys to make left/right or up/down swipes on the matrix.
